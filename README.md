# HW20-react-portfolio

## Description

This website was created as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp. The task was to create a portfolio using React to showcase the developer's work during the course. Some of the projects on the portfolio page are placeholders. During this assignment, I learned a lot about how React works both similarly and differently to the tools I am used to using in the course so far.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Visit the website at https://main--prismatic-sunburst-e80fc5.netlify.app/.
It doesn't quite work correctly deployed, unfortunately.
